ZimSchola Hub – a smart solution to school management

Overview

A Web based school management system that is tailor made for the Zimbabwean Education system. It's made to cater for both Primary and Secondary Schools. It will be used for the tedious tasks of scheming, marks collection and preparation of school reports. It will also be used for managing the school calendar with every user being notified of such events upon logging in.
It can be deployed on both a local or remote server and be accessible both within and out of the school premises. This makes it easy for teachers to manage their classes and schemes even during holidays and weekends. Students can use it to check the targets that their teachers have set for them every week thereby they can read ahead and get all necessary materials needed for those lessons.
